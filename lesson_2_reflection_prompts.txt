1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	There is a .git file added to the repository/file. So to create a .git file, make it a git repository.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Repository mean the entire document. Staging area is a place where you can add files to it for the preparation of commit. Working directory is the place where u work on it?

3.How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Use commend git stage, and you can see and check how many files u add to the staging area. And if there is only one file in the staging area, you can make sure the commit you make now whould only be that one file change.
